# Lessons

In exerns, you name parent vars after the their node/require file name (I think). Not their temporary variable name.

# Questions

1. Why do these not return the same thing?

	   (.-file_extension returned-yaml-object)
	   (aget returned-yaml-object "file_extension")

# Code Dump

(defn yaml-table-config->chan-array-header-columns [ext]
    (get-yaml-config string synchronously)
    (determine how many documents n are in the config string)
    (fill channel of size 1 with first yaml document that matches ext)
    (suck document from channel and convert it into js array columns object)
    (construct js columns object from matching object)); stick it in channel))
